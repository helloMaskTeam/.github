We are a team to mask the complexity for indie hackers or startups :rocket::rocket:.

Indie hackers and start-up founders are some of the most creative and passionate people out there. 
They have brilliant ideas, a strong drive to succeed, and the courage to take risks. 
However, when it comes to building their products, many struggle with the technical complexity and the high costs of development. 
That's why we at TheMask are building open source apps and guides that make software development more accessible and affordable for everyone.
